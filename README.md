Mint HUD
===

This is a GTK application to open an overlay displaying common shortcuts for Linux Mint with 
the Cinnamon desktop manager.
At the moment the shortcuts are hardcoded (tssk), but will hopefully be improved in time.


Installation
---

Move the executable to your local path,

```bash
cp ./mint-hud.py ~/.local/bin/mint-hud.py
```

and create a `.desktop` file in `~/local/share/applications/` that uses the executable.
